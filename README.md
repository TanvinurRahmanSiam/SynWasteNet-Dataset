# Synthetic Outdoor Waste Detection Dataset

This repository provides a synthetic outdoor waste detection dataset
designed for object detection research in uncontrolled outdoor environments.

The dataset contains 6,000 images annotated with 10 waste categories
in YOLO format. Images are generated using a controlled synthetic pipeline
that combines real waste object crops with diverse outdoor backgrounds.

- Total images: 6,000
- Classes: 10
- Resolution: 640 × 640
- Annotation format: YOLO (normalized bounding boxes)
